To generate JUnit tests for Java sources with low test coverage, you can follow the steps and recommendations outlined in the Nasdanika tools and practices documentation:

1. **Set Up Coverage Reporting**: 
   - Use a code coverage tool like JaCoCo to gather test coverage data. After running your tests, JaCoCo generates a `jacoco.exec` file that contains detailed coverage information.

2. **Analyze Coverage Data**:
   - Analyze the coverage data to identify classes and methods with low test coverage. This involves loading the `jacoco.exec` file and associated bytecode to build a coverage model using the Nasdanika tools (refer to [Java Practice](https://docs.nasdanika.org/practices/java/index.html) and [GitLab JUnit with JaCoCo](https://docs.nasdanika.org/nsd-cli/nsd/gitlab/contribute/junit/jacoco/index.html)).

3. **Generate JUnit Tests**:
   - Use the Nasdanika CLI tool to automate the generation of JUnit tests. The command `nsd java junit` can be used to generate tests based on the identified low coverage methods, leveraging optional Gen AI assistance for creating meaningful test cases.
   - Example command to generate tests with coverage analysis: 
     ```shell
     nsd java junit --api-key=<Your OpenAI API Key> --sources=src/main/java --output=generated-tests <projectURI> <coverageThreshold>
     ```
   - Here, `projectURI` is your project location, and `coverageThreshold` specifies the minimum coverage percentage required for a method to skip test generation.

4. **Review and Integrate Tests**:
   - Generated tests are delivered for developer review. It's important to manually check and modify these tests to ensure they are correct and maintainable.
   - Consider integrating these tests into your test suite and using annotations like `@Disabled` to indicate tests that are auto-generated and need further attention or validation.

5. **Leverage Gen AI**:
   - The Nasdanika tools support leveraging Gen AI for test generation by interacting with models like ChatGPT to propose test scenarios that cover the missing branches or conditions in your code. This can be controlled via specific CLI options to utilize AI services (refer to [Java Model and Practices](https://docs.nasdanika.org/practices/junit/index.html)).

6. **Automation and CI/CD Integration**:
   - For continuous integration setups, automate the entire process via your CI/CD pipelines, integrating tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI to automate the test generation and execution stages.
   
This streamlined approach utilizes a combination of coverage analysis, programmatic test generation, and Gen AI to improve test coverage efficiently and systematically, ensuring a more robust and quality-tested codebase.
